# Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis of GSE279086 Using Seurat

This repository contains a comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of the publicly available GSE279086 dataset. The analysis was conducted using the Seurat (v5) framework in an R environment (Kaggle Notebook).
The project focuses on exploring transcriptional diversity at single-cell resolution and identifying biologically meaningful cellular subpopulations.

# Study Goals
The objectives of this analysis are to:
1. Process and curate raw single-cell RNA-seq data from GSE279086
2. Perform rigorous quality control to remove low-quality cells
3. Identify highly variable genes driving cellular heterogeneity
4. Reduce dimensionality to visualize cellular structure
5. Detect transcriptionally distinct clusters
6. Determine cluster-specific marker genes
7. Interpret cellular composition based on gene expression patterns
